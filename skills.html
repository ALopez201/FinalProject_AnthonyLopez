    <p>During this semester there were many significant aspects of website development we learned. Initially, we went
        over historical aspects of the internet. While covering this topic, we discussed how early technologies set
        the stage for the technology we use today. People like Grace Hopper, who created the language necessary for
        us to type and buid programs with was also a topic of discussion at this stage. After learning about this,
        we got a better understanding of what our technology derived from and where it has arrived.

    <h3>GIT, GITHUB, AFS & LOCAL AND REMOTE HOSTS</h3>
    <p>
        After learning the historical context of the internet, we began to utilize tools pertaining to internet
        development. The first one we observed was Git (Webstorm). This integrated development environment (IDE)
        helped us hone our developing skills in an array of different ways. One way was in our ability to manage
        projects as a team. We established our groups and began to work on one of numerous group assignments,
        making commits and pushing and pulling data to reflect our contributions. The projects got gradually more
        complex as the semester went on. We were introduced to new commands and html coding pretty much every week.
        Next, we learned how t utilize our Andrew file system (AFS) profiles to host web pages from our school's
        server. This was an important lesson because we learned how to move files seamlessly across different hosts
        without having to drag and drop files. It also taught us how to create files and directories without having
        to constantly click, and also how to track these files and directories. A number of weeks passed until we
        had a good understanding of how to perform these tasks, and then we moved on to cascading style sheets (CSS)
        coding. This stage was when we learned how to right-click and inspect pages to make more streamlined
        customizations to our web pages. We then dabbled in different page layouts and observed new ways to facilitate
        our coding such as bootstrap. Towards the end of the semester we began working on our final individual and
        group projects, which this actual page in particular represents!

    <h3>TAKEAWAYS & CONCLUSION</h3>
    <p>
        In conclusion, IS117 taught us a lot about not just developing web pages, but coordinating during the process.
        The skills we obtained under the tutelage of professor Williams was very valuable, as were the life lessons.
        Working in groups not only helped prepare us with respect to the technology, but also with respect to the
        possibility of future jobs requiring us to work with others. Using slack to collaborate was also an efficient
        means of communication. As we got more familiar with our groups, we even learned from each other. Professor was
        always available to help, which was really convenient for us. Over all, I could definitely picture myself using the
        skills we learned in the future. Not just in our careers, but in our personal lives. As daily tasks become more
        automated, the skills taught in this class become more desirable. These skills also serve as a useful foundation
        for skills we may be required to learn in the future. Because of this, I definitely appreciate the useful skills
        and lessons taught by our professor and had a pleasant experience this semester.
