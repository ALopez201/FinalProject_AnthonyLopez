        <h3>My three favourite Web Sites:</h3>

        <p>I know HTML which is Hypertext Markup Language and the set of markup symbols and codes. I can use HTML to create my own basic website page, and also I can apply a lot of codes to make my page look more professional.<br > Moreover, I can make the sheets look more organize and neat and have different styles . </p>
        <p>I would like to learn how to create my own website, and include effect of the Photoshop CS6 &amp; Flash. Also, I would like to challenge with my classmates who know more about the Technology than me. </p>
        <p>My favourite quote :</p>
